# My real name is King Emhyr (*last name is not provided*)

C++ is my first programming language. I live on the edge.

I binged watch an 8 hour video about C++ in one sitting and only retained 70% of the things because my brain went goopy near the end of the video.

i use arch btw

i dont use any stinky ass *library*, i implement my own shit. how does printing work? make a print function yourself, dipshit.
except, sometimes, i get too lazy and just use the stl.

i restart projects just because i dislike the style guide i followed... many, and many times.

i don't follow people's choices, i come up with my own: i think of my own data structures and algorithms and implement them.
